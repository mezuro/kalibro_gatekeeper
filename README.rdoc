Mezuro is a source code tracking platform based on Noosfero social networking
platform with Mezuro Plugin actived to access Kalibro Web Service.

=== Development


* System dependencies (Ubuntu package names)

  * build-essential

  * curl

* Ruby version

  2.1.2

  You can easily install it through the Ruby Version Manager - RVM. Instructions on how to do it can be found at http://rvm.io

  *NOTE:* If you are using the gnome-shell, or any derivate like terminator, you have to mark on your profile the option to use a "login bash".


* Configuration

    bundle install

* Database creation

    rake db:setup

* How to run the test suite

    rake

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

  Kalibro Web Service 1.0 r6
  You can find a script to install it on Ubuntu at https://gist.github.com/m45t3r/0c4ad3b5700c6364abf1/f77701622ddc1d54d84757cc9ab59811e0ad6124 (if you're brave https://gist.github.com/rafamanzo/6179925/ shows a unstable script with JBoss instead of Tomcat)

* Deployment instructions

  Deployment is made through Capistano (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)

    cap production deploy

  In order to do this, you must have the password.

  Otherwise, you can also modify the deployment file at <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt>.

=== Install

  1. Make sure that the deployment file <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt> is correctly configured to the installation server;
  2. Also, make sure that the installation server already has rvm installed;
  3. <tt>cap deploy:setup</tt> will install the ruby correct ruby version, the gemset and all the directories tree;
  4. <tt>cap deploy:migrations</tt> deploys the code and run all the migrations
